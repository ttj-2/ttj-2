### Hello! I'm Ty Johnson(he/him) :) 

I graduated with a B.S. in Engineering Physics from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in spring '23 and I'm continuting my studies toward a M.S. in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State Univeristy in fall '23!

- I'm currently working on analysis of urban aerosol plume data, increasing detail of particle classifications for intercomparison with mass spectrometery field data.
